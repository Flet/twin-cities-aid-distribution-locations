# Code of Conduct

The Twin Cities Aid Map comunity welcomes participation from everyone. 

## Expectations 

Our community expects that participants:

* Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment
* Are safe, respected, friendly, and free to fully express their identities
* Presume the value of everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions
* Don’t assume everyone has the same context 
* Encourage participation, questions, and discussion
* Find ways for people to productively contribute their skills (technical and not) and energy. 
* Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak
* Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process
* Ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
* Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members and community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive

Our community members organize with resources of [Open Twin Cities](https://www.opentwincities.org/), so members are obliged to abide by that orgainzation's similar [code of conduct](https://www.opentwincities.org/about/#code-of-conduct).
