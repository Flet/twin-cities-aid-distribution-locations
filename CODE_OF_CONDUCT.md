# Code of Conduct

The Twin Cities Aid Map comunity welcomes participation from everyone. 

## Expectations 

Our community expects that participants:

* Provide an environment where people are free from discrimination or harassment
* Are safe, respected, friendly, and free to fully express their identities
* Presume the value of everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions
* Don’t assume everyone has the same context 
* Encourage participation, questions, and discussion
* Find ways for people to productively contribute their time and skills (technical or not) 
* Take responsibility for their words and actions
* Prioritize access for and input from those who are traditionally excluded from the civic process
* Ensure our local community is well-represented in the design and implementation of projects. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
* Ensure that the relationships and conversations between contributors and local community partners remain respectful, participatory, and productive
